# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.1.8] - 2025-07-07

### Fixed
- Incremented version to resolve PyPI "File already exists" error.

## [0.1.7] - 2025-07-07

### Changed
- Refactored `PincodeData` methods (`get_state`, `get_district`, `get_taluk`, `get_offices`) to use a common helper method `_get_info_field` for improved code reusability and maintainability.
- Ensured type hint compatibility with `mypy` by explicitly casting return types where necessary.

### Technical Improvements
- Implemented `lru_cache` for `_get_default_instance` to ensure `PincodeData` is a singleton and loaded only once, optimizing performance for repeated calls to convenience functions.
- Removed redundant global variable `_default_pincode_data` for a cleaner and more minimal codebase, leveraging `lru_cache` for instance management.
- Removed duplicate import statements (`os`, `re`).

## Migration Guide from v0.1.2 to v0.2.0

### Breaking Changes
- Package structure changed from simple functions to comprehensive API
- Function signatures updated with type hints
- Error handling improved with custom exceptions

### Migration Steps

**Old usage (v0.1.2):**
```python
from pinin.util import get_state, get_location
state = get_state(110001)
location = get_location(110001)
```

**New usage (v0.2.0):**
```python
from pinin import get_state, get_district, get_pincode_info
state = get_state("110001")  # Now accepts string or int
district = get_district("110001")  # More specific than location
info = get_pincode_info("110001")  # Complete information
```

### New Features Available
- Comprehensive search capabilities
- CLI tool for command-line usage
- Better error handling and validation
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Extensive documentation and examples

---

## Development Notes

### v0.2.0 Development Process
- Analyzed existing toksum library structure for modern Python practices
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with pytest and mocking
- Added type hints throughout for better developer experience
- Created extensive documentation and examples
- Implemented CLI tool with argparse for command-line usage
- Added pandas for efficient data operations
- Implemented proper exception hierarchy
- Added support for custom data files and configurations

### Future Roadmap
- [ ] Add caching for improved performance
