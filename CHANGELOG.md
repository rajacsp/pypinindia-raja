## Migration Guide from v0.1.2 to v0.2.0

### Breaking Changes
- Package structure changed from simple functions to comprehensive API
- Function signatures updated with type hints
- Error handling improved with custom exceptions

### Migration Steps

**Old usage (v0.1.2):**
```python
from pinin.util import get_state, get_location
state = get_state(110001)
location = get_location(110001)
```

**New usage (v0.2.0):**
```python
from pinin import get_state, get_district, get_pincode_info
state = get_state("110001")  # Now accepts string or int
district = get_district("110001")  # More specific than location
info = get_pincode_info("110001")  # Complete information
```

### New Features Available
- Comprehensive search capabilities
- CLI tool for command-line usage
- Better error handling and validation
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Extensive documentation and examples

## Development Notes

### v0.2.0 Development Process
- Analyzed existing toksum library structure for modern Python practices
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with pytest and mocking
- Added type hints throughout for better developer experience
- Created extensive documentation and examples
- Implemented CLI tool with argparse for command-line usage
- Added pandas for efficient data operations
- Implemented proper exception hierarchy
